## About

Our plan is to create an application similar to the Spotify interface on signup which allows users to select what is important to them with regards to their home buying process. Once they have selected their topics they will see a Google Map with pins of local houses they can purchase.

### Topics

### Tech Stack

React
Node.js
Azure CloudDB

### User Stories

As a user I want to be able to find a house
As a user I want the house to be x,y,z
As a user I want this to be mobile first
As a user I want the UI to be easy to use

### Walkthrough

User will enter their post code for local radius of house purchase
User will then select from bubbles on screen the topics which are important to them and click 'Generate options'
User will see list of properties and pins in map to show where these are

### Future Features

- Ability for user to book a viewing
- Ability for user to compare pricing of other aspects of important in the area, for example car insurance, childcare costs, home insurance etc

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
