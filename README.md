## About

Our plan is to create an application similar to the Spotify interface on signup which allows users to select what is important to them with regards to their home buying process. Once they have selected their topics they will see a Google Map with pins of local houses they can purchase.

### Topics

### Tech Stack

React
Node.js
Azure CloudDB

### User Stories

As a user I want to be able to find a house
As a user I want the house to be x,y,z
As a user I want this to be mobile first
As a user I want the UI to be clear

### Walkthrough

User will enter their post code for local radius of house purchase
User will then select from bubbles on screen the topics which are important to them and click 'Generate options'
User will see list of properties and pins in map to show where these are

### Future Features

- Ability for user to book a viewing
- Ability for user to compare pricing of other aspects of important in the area, for example car insurance, childcare costs, home insurance etc
